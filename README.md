#### A text editor using Java: 
I built a simple text editor where one can write a text file and save it in a location within your system. This is done using Java (Java Swing, Java AWT). It has two menus in the menu bar: File and Edit. 
- File consists of three futher menus: Open (for opening the file), save (for saving the file) and exit (for closing the file).
- Edit consists of three further menus: Cut, copy and paste.
